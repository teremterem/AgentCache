## 🔧 Implementation details

This framework is async-first, and uses the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library to
achieve concurrency. The classes also have synchronous versions of the methods here and there, but the full potential
of the framework is only unlocked when using the async methods. It is designed to support Python 3.8 or higher.
